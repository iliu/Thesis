Outline

\todo{make sure to add in timing anomalies}

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Discuss the problem
  \item show the difficulty in execution time analysis of a simple c code
  \item show the variability different architecture improvements have introduced to improve average case execution time (Sami's graph)
\end{itemize}

With designs being pushed to higher and higher levels of abstraction, we need lower levels to provide robust, non brittle fundamentals in which we can reason about timing guarantees.

The remaining chapters are organized as follows. 
Chapter~\ref{chapter:related} surveys the related research that has been done on architectures to make them more analyzable.
Chapter~\ref{chapter:pret} explains the architecture of PRET including the \thdint pipeline and memory hierarchy, Chapter~\ref{chapter:pret_wcet}, Chapter~\ref{chapter:app}, Chapter~\ref{chapter:summary},
