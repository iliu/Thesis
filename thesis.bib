  title = {Automated Memory Allocation of Actor Code and Data Buffer in Heterochronous
	Dataflow Models to Scratchpad Memory},
  school = {University of California, Berkeley},
  year = {2006},
  month = {August},
  abstract = {A scratchpad memory is a fast compiler-managed on-chip memory that
	replaces the hardware managed cache in several embedded processors.
	Scratchpad memories provide better real-time guarantees, and significantly
	lower overheads in energy consumption and area as compared to caches
	[9]. Several allocation schemes exist for mapping variables, data
	and code to the scratchpad memory. However, none of these schemes
	seek to optimize the allocation based on the control flow and data
	flow information that can be gleaned from block diagram based programs
	in frameworks in LabVIEW and Ptolemy II [7]. In this report we present
	methods for scratchpad memory allocation of block diagram programs
	composed under the Heterochronous Dataflow (HDF) model of computation
	[3]. HDF is a heterogeneous composition of Synchronous Dataflow (SDF)
	[1] and Finite State Machines (FSM). It is significantly more expressive
	than SDF since it allows rate changes in actors during execution.
	The memory allocation method exploits the coarse grained software
	architecture and semantics of the HDF models to gather information
	about the temporal pattern and access frequencies of memory references
	and the memory requirements of the computational blocks. This information
	is processed using an Integer Linear Program (ILP) based framework
	to generate the optimal memory allocation for each state in the HDF
	graph. We also present a modified version of the algorithm which
	generates multiple allocations for each state. The ILP based allocation
	algorithm is shown to perform significantly better than caches. We
	also show that the allocation algorithm increases predictability
	by being completely independent of the scheduling technique used
	to generate the execution schedule for the HDF model. The algorithmic
	modification that generates multiple allocations per state is shown
	to perform better than the original algorithm for actor code allocation
	for intermediate scratchpad sizes. We present a strict upper bound
	on the memory access time of a HDF model allocated to scratchpad
	using the above algorithm. We also present several interesting directions
	for future exploration.},

  abstract = {Our aim is to investigate the suitability of hardware multithreading
	for real-time event handling in combination with appropriate real-time
	scheduling techniques. We designed and evaluated a multithreaded
	microcontroller based on a Java processore core. Java threads are
	used as Interrupt Service Threads (ITSs) instead of the Interrupt
	Service Routines (ISRs) of conventional processors. Our propsed Komodo
	microcontroller supports multiple ISTs with zero-cycle context switching
	overhead. A so-called priority manager implements several real-time
	scheduling algorithms in hardware. We show the feasibility of a hardware
	real-time scheduler integrated deeply into the processor pipeline
	with a VHDL design and its synthesis. Evaluations with a software
	simulator and real-time applications as benchmarks show that hardware
	multithreading reaches a 1.2-1.4 performance increase for hard real-time
	requirements. With respect to real-time scheduling on a multithreaded
	microcontroller, the Least Laxity First (LLF) scheme outperforms
	the Fixed Priority Prreemptive (EPP), Earliest Deadline First (EDF),
	and Guaranteed Percentage (GP) schemes, but suffers from the highest
	implementation costs.},

	processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the
	physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes
	affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential
	of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and
	major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology.
	There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical
	components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements
	qualitatively different from those in general-purpose computing.
	Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented
	software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls
	and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing
	such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today's
	computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation
	for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design
	processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or
	otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize
	the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and
	networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace
	physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.},

  abstract = {The precision timed architecture presents a real-time embedded processor
	with instruction-set extensions that provide precise timing control
	via timing instructions to the programmer. Programmers not only describe
	their functionality using C, but they can also prescribe timing requirements
	in the program. We target this architecture and present a static
	scratchpad memory allocation scheme that greedily attempts to meet
	these timing requirements. Our objective is to schedule minimum number
	of instructions and minimize data allocation to the scratchpads such
	that timing requirements in the program are met. Once the timing
	requirements are satisfied, the remainder of the scratchpad memory
	can be used to optimize some other metric desired by the programmer.
	As an example, we minimize the frequency of main memory accesses
	in the program. This work presents the following: 1) high-level timing
	constructs for C that synthesize to timing instructions and 2) a
	greedy iterative instruction and data scratchpad memory allocation
	scheme that attempts to first meet the specified timing requirements.},

	the worst-case execution time analysis necessary for hard real-time
	embedded systems. Our work introduces a novel DRAM controller design
	that is predictable and that significantly reduces worst-case access
	latencies. Instead of viewing the DRAM device as one resource that
	can only be shared as a whole, our approach views it as multiple
	resources that can be shared between one or more clients individually.
	We partition the physical address space following the internal structure
	of the DRAM device, i.e., its ranks and banks, and interleave accesses
	to the blocks of this partition. This eliminates contention for shared
	resources within the device, making accesses temporally predictable
	and temporally isolated. This paper describes our DRAM controller
	design and its integration with a precision-timed (PRET) architecture
	called PTARM. We present analytical bounds on the latency and throughput
	of the proposed controller, and confirm these via simulation.},

	of threats for computers. Unlike physical side channel attacks that
	mostly target embedded cryptographic devices, cache-based side channel
	attacks can also undermine general purpose systems. The attacks are
	easy to perform, effective on most platforms, and do not require
	special instruments or excessive computation power. In recently demonstrated
	attacks on software implementations of ciphers like AES and RSA,
	the full key can be recovered by an unprivileged user program performing
	simple timing measurements based on cache misses. <p>We first analyze
	these attacks, identifying cache interference as the root cause of
	these attacks. We identify two basic mitigation approaches: the partition-based
	approach eliminates cache interference whereas the randomization-based
	approach randomizes cache interference so that zero information can
	be inferred. We present new security-aware cache designs, the Partition-Locked
	cache (PLcache) and Random Permutation cache (RPcache), analyze and
	prove their security, and evaluate their performance. Our results
	show that our new cache designs with built-in security can defend
	against cache-based side channel attacks in general ? rather than
	only specific attacks on a given cryptographic algorithm ? with very
	little performance degradation and hardware cost.},

  pages = {205--214},
  abstract = {A combination of a scratchpad and scratchpad memory management unit
	(SMMU) has been proposed as a way to implement fast and time-predictable
	memory access operations in programs that use dynamic data structures.
	A memory access operation is time-predictable if its execution time
	is known or bounded -- this is important within a hard real-time
	task so that the worst-case execution time (WCET) can be determined.
	However, the requirement for time-predictability does not remove
	the conventional requirement for efficiency: operations must be serviced
	as quickly as possible under worst-case conditions.
	
	This paper studies the capabilities of the SMMU when applied to a
	number of benchmark programs. A new allocation algorithm is proposed
	to dynamically manage the scratchpad space. In many cases, the SMMU
	vastly reduces the number of accesses to dynamic data structures
	stored in external memory along the worst-case execution path (WCEP).
	Across all the benchmarks, an average of 47% of accesses are rerouted
	to scratchpad, with nearly 100% for some programs. In previous scratchpad-based

  abstract = {Scratchpads have been widely proposed as an alternative to caches
	for embedded systems. Advantages of scratchpads include reduced energy
	consumption in comparison to a cache and access latencies that are
	independent of the preceding memory access pattern. The latter property
	makes memory accesses time-predictable, which is useful for hard
	real-time tasks as the worst-case execution time (WCET) must be safely
	estimated in order to check that the system will meet timing requirements.
	
	However, data must be explicitly moved between scratchpad and external
	memory as a task executes in order to make best use of the limited
	scratchpad space. When dynamic data is moved, issues such as pointer
	aliasing and pointer invalidation become problematic. Previous work
	has proposed solutions that are not suitable for hard real-time tasks
	because memory accesses are not time-predictable.
	
	This paper proposes the scratchpad memory management unit (SMMU) as
	an enhancement to scratchpad technology. The SMMU implements an alternative
	solution to the pointer aliasing and pointer invalidation problems
	which (1) does not require whole-program pointer analysis and (2)
	makes every memory access operation time-predictable. This allows
	WCET analysis to be applied to hard-real time tasks which use a scratchpad
	and dynamic data, but results are also applicable in the wider context
	of minimizing energy consumption or average execution time. Experiments
	using C software show that the combination of an SMMU and scratchpad
	compares favorably with the best and worst case performance of a
	conventional data cache.},

  pages = {445--455},
  abstract = {The problem of worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis of complex
	CPUs is addressed in this paper using a proposed architectural modification.
	The virtual trace controller (VTC) constrains execution to follow
	only the paths that have been considered by the WCET analysis model,
	allowing the WCET to be determined safely by measurement. Each path
	has a constant execution time regardless of CPU complexity because
	the VTC enforces predictable operation. This paper evaluates the
	VTC using benchmark programs and the M5 simulator.
	
	The results show that guaranteed throughput is increased for many
	programs using the constrained CPU model versus an idealised in-order
	design, indicating that the VTC can make complex CPU designs operate
	predictably without reducing throughput to the level of a simple
	CPU design. Additional results provide more information about the
	implications of each of the VTC features. Of all the restrictions
	introduced for predictability, disabling memory forwarding has the
	greatest effect on the maximum throughput, although conditional branches
	can also be significant. This paper suggests ways to improve the
	VTC to increase the guaranteed throughput.},
