  abstract = {Our aim is to investigate the suitability of hardware multithreading
	for real-time event handling in combination with appropriate real-time
	scheduling techniques. We designed and evaluated a multithreaded
	microcontroller based on a Java processore core. Java threads are
	used as Interrupt Service Threads (ITSs) instead of the Interrupt
	Service Routines (ISRs) of conventional processors. Our propsed Komodo
	microcontroller supports multiple ISTs with zero-cycle context switching
	overhead. A so-called priority manager implements several real-time
	scheduling algorithms in hardware. We show the feasibility of a hardware
	real-time scheduler integrated deeply into the processor pipeline
	with a VHDL design and its synthesis. Evaluations with a software
	simulator and real-time applications as benchmarks show that hardware
	multithreading reaches a 1.2-1.4 performance increase for hard real-time
	requirements. With respect to real-time scheduling on a multithreaded
	microcontroller, the Least Laxity First (LLF) scheme outperforms
	the Fixed Priority Prreemptive (EPP), Earliest Deadline First (EDF),
	and Guaranteed Percentage (GP) schemes, but suffers from the highest
	implementation costs.},

  abstract = {The precision timed architecture presents a real-time embedded processor
	with instruction-set extensions that provide precise timing control
	via timing instructions to the programmer. Programmers not only describe
	their functionality using C, but they can also prescribe timing requirements
	in the program. We target this architecture and present a static
	scratchpad memory allocation scheme that greedily attempts to meet
	these timing requirements. Our objective is to schedule minimum number
	of instructions and minimize data allocation to the scratchpads such
	that timing requirements in the program are met. Once the timing
	requirements are satisfied, the remainder of the scratchpad memory
	can be used to optimize some other metric desired by the programmer.
	As an example, we minimize the frequency of main memory accesses
	in the program. This work presents the following: 1) high-level timing
	constructs for C that synthesize to timing instructions and 2) a
	greedy iterative instruction and data scratchpad memory allocation
	scheme that attempts to first meet the specified timing requirements.},

  abstract = {A combination of a scratchpad and scratchpad memory management unit
	(SMMU) has been proposed as a way to implement fast and time-predictable
	memory access operations in programs that use dynamic data structures.
	A memory access operation is time-predictable if its execution time
	is known or bounded -- this is important within a hard real-time
	task so that the worst-case execution time (WCET) can be determined.
	However, the requirement for time-predictability does not remove
	the conventional requirement for efficiency: operations must be serviced
	as quickly as possible under worst-case conditions.
	
	This paper studies the capabilities of the SMMU when applied to a
	number of benchmark programs. A new allocation algorithm is proposed
	to dynamically manage the scratchpad space. In many cases, the SMMU
	vastly reduces the number of accesses to dynamic data structures
	stored in external memory along the worst-case execution path (WCEP).
	Across all the benchmarks, an average of 47% of accesses are rerouted
	to scratchpad, with nearly 100% for some programs. In previous scratchpad-based
	work, time-predictability could only be assured for these operations
	using external memory. The paper also examines situations in which
	the SMMU does not perform so well, and discusses how these could
	be addressed.},

  pages = {265--274},
  abstract = {Scratchpads have been widely proposed as an alternative to caches
	for embedded systems. Advantages of scratchpads include reduced energy
	consumption in comparison to a cache and access latencies that are
	independent of the preceding memory access pattern. The latter property
	makes memory accesses time-predictable, which is useful for hard
	real-time tasks as the worst-case execution time (WCET) must be safely
	estimated in order to check that the system will meet timing requirements.
	
	However, data must be explicitly moved between scratchpad and external
	memory as a task executes in order to make best use of the limited
	scratchpad space. When dynamic data is moved, issues such as pointer
	aliasing and pointer invalidation become problematic. Previous work
	has proposed solutions that are not suitable for hard real-time tasks
	because memory accesses are not time-predictable.
	
	This paper proposes the scratchpad memory management unit (SMMU) as
	an enhancement to scratchpad technology. The SMMU implements an alternative
	solution to the pointer aliasing and pointer invalidation problems
	which (1) does not require whole-program pointer analysis and (2)
	makes every memory access operation time-predictable. This allows
	WCET analysis to be applied to hard-real time tasks which use a scratchpad
	and dynamic data, but results are also applicable in the wider context
	of minimizing energy consumption or average execution time. Experiments
	using C software show that the combination of an SMMU and scratchpad
	compares favorably with the best and worst case performance of a
	conventional data cache.},

	The virtual trace controller (VTC) constrains execution to follow
	only the paths that have been considered by the WCET analysis model,
	allowing the WCET to be determined safely by measurement. Each path
	has a constant execution time regardless of CPU complexity because
	the VTC enforces predictable operation. This paper evaluates the
	VTC using benchmark programs and the M5 simulator.
	
	The results show that guaranteed throughput is increased for many
	programs using the constrained CPU model versus an idealised in-order
	design, indicating that the VTC can make complex CPU designs operate
	predictably without reducing throughput to the level of a simple
	CPU design. Additional results provide more information about the
	implications of each of the VTC features. Of all the restrictions
	introduced for predictability, disabling memory forwarding has the
	greatest effect on the maximum throughput, although conditional branches
	can also be significant. This paper suggests ways to improve the
	VTC to increase the guaranteed throughput.},
