  abstract = {Our aim is to investigate the suitability of hardware multithreading
	for real-time event handling in combination with appropriate real-time
	scheduling techniques. We designed and evaluated a multithreaded
	microcontroller based on a Java processore core. Java threads are
	used as Interrupt Service Threads (ITSs) instead of the Interrupt
	Service Routines (ISRs) of conventional processors. Our propsed Komodo
	microcontroller supports multiple ISTs with zero-cycle context switching
	overhead. A so-called priority manager implements several real-time
	scheduling algorithms in hardware. We show the feasibility of a hardware
	real-time scheduler integrated deeply into the processor pipeline
	with a VHDL design and its synthesis. Evaluations with a software
	simulator and real-time applications as benchmarks show that hardware
	multithreading reaches a 1.2-1.4 performance increase for hard real-time
	requirements. With respect to real-time scheduling on a multithreaded
	microcontroller, the Least Laxity First (LLF) scheme outperforms
	the Fixed Priority Prreemptive (EPP), Earliest Deadline First (EDF),
	and Guaranteed Percentage (GP) schemes, but suffers from the highest
	implementation costs.},

  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {The precision timed architecture presents a real-time embedded processor
	with instruction-set extensions that provide precise timing control
	via timing instructions to the programmer. Programmers not only describe
	their functionality using C, but they can also prescribe timing requirements
	in the program. We target this architecture and present a static
	scratchpad memory allocation scheme that greedily attempts to meet
	these timing requirements. Our objective is to schedule minimum number
	of instructions and minimize data allocation to the scratchpads such
	that timing requirements in the program are met. Once the timing
	requirements are satisfied, the remainder of the scratchpad memory
	can be used to optimize some other metric desired by the programmer.
	As an example, we minimize the frequency of main memory accesses
	in the program. This work presents the following: 1) high-level timing
	constructs for C that synthesize to timing instructions and 2) a
	greedy iterative instruction and data scratchpad memory allocation
	scheme that attempts to first meet the specified timing requirements.},
